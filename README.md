# Spotify Most Streamed Songs Analysis

A data analysis project exploring patterns in Spotify's most popular songs using Python and Pandas.

## About
This is a learning project to practice Python data analysis skills, specifically focusing on Pandas for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis.

## Data Source
This analysis uses the [Spotify Most Streamed Songs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulszz/spotify-most-streamed-songs) from Kaggle.

## Questions Explored
- Which artists appear most frequently in the top streamed songs?
- How have streaming patterns changed over time?
- Is there a correlation between playlist/chart placement and stream counts?
- What audio characteristics (danceability, energy, etc.) are common in popular songs?

## Key Findings
- Spotify holds the largest number of streams, suggesting the platform's reach naturally leads to a wider audience
- Popular streamed songs predominantly come from the 2000s onwards, aligning with when music streaming grew in popularity

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy jupyter`
3. Open `spotify_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells

## Future Iterations
I plan to continue exploring this dataset and add data visualizations as I learn those skills.
